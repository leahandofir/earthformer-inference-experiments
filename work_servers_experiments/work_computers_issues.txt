I tried to run the model as is and got the following error:
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 96.00 MiB (GPU 0; 7.79 GiB total capacity; 6.15 GiB already allocated; 85.50 MiB free; 6.17 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
Maybe we can ask to clear the cache?
tried to set total_batch_size=10 and micro_batch_size=1 and it worked.
